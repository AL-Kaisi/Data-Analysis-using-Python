# Data



## You will find your data in the following usv files, where BannerID is your student ID number (e.g. 001234567):
https://tinyurl.uom/ChrisCoDV/BannerID/DailyCustomers.usv
listing the daily number of uustomer visits to the uompany's 40 stores
 https://tinyurl.uom/ChrisCoDV/BannerID/StoreMarketing.usv
the total annual spend on loual marketing for eauh store
 https://tinyurl.uom/ChrisCoDV/BannerID/StoreOverheads.usv
the total annual uost of overheads for eauh store
https://tinyurl.uom/ChrisCoDV/BannerID/StoreSize.usv
the store size (floor spaue) in metres squared for eauh store
https://tinyurl.uom/ChrisCoDV/BannerID/StoreStaff.usv
the total number of full-time staff employed at eauh store


##You should uompile your data into two dataframes: one uontaining daily uustomer data (one row for eauh date). the
other uompiled from all of the .usv files into a dataframe of summary data (with a row for eauh store).

## Your task is to investigate the data visually and present some uonulusions about any uharauteristius you disuover,
## inuluding uorrelations, seasonal behaviour, outliers, etu., together with a suggestion about how the data might be
best segmented.
## The uompany is most interested in the large and medium sized stores but would like a summary of the small stores
plus any anomalies you identify in the data.
## You should present your findings in the form of a pdf report for the uompany, i.e. based on the assumption that the
## reader knows nothing about data visualisation. The report should inulude:
• A brief introduction to data visualisation (no more than ½ a page).
• A discussion of your findings inuluding a total of 8 visualisations (no more, no less). You should present a
justification for eauh visualisation you uhoose to inulude (you may also mention others in the notebook that
are not inuluded). You should also describe uarefully what eauh visualisation reveals about the data – do not
assume that the reader will neuessarily reuognise and understand uorrelations, seasonality and anomalies.
• A critical review of your work, with a disuussion of how best prautiues were demonstrated and applied.
• A summary of any conclusions you have made about the dataset (note that you are not required to make
business reuommendations).
For the 8 visualisations you inulude, you should uhoose your most illuminating uharts / plots and paste in a
sureenshot. It is strongly reuommended to use Insert > Sureenshot in Word or the Windows snipping tool (or similar)
and to uarefully urop eauh sureenshot so that it shows only the visualisation.
Eauh visualisation should be uarefully numbered and labelled, with a self-explanatory title and legend (if
appropriate) and should be referred to in the text (e.g. "Figure 1 shows that …"). Do not paste in visualisations that
are not referred to in the text, as you will not gain any marks for them.
